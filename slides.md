### Reproduce paper / Hack the ReproHack

1. **Project review and team formation**

### Replicate your paper

- Finished early? Consider attempting **replication**!
- Replications could be considered for publication in **ReScience C** Journal


---

### [ReScience C](http://rescience.github.io/)

> **ReScience C** is an open-access peer-reviewed journal that targets computational research and encourages the explicit replication of already published research, promoting new and open-source implementations in order to ensure that the original research is reproducible.

---

### **Replication:** 
- Repeating a published protocol
- Respecting its spirit and intentions
-  **Varying the technical details**, e.g. using different software, initial conditions, etc.

***

#### Change something that everyone believes shouldnâ€™t matter, and see if the scientific conclusions are affected 

---

### Feed back

- **Regroup part way through** to discuss progress and troubleshoot any sticking points
- **Feedback to authors** using form by end of session
- **Feedback to group** at the end

---
