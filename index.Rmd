# **Welcome `r emo::ji("wave")` **

We are all excited by the progress made by many authors to **make their papers reproducible by publishing associated code and data**. 

We know how challenging it can be so we **want to showcase the value of the practice**, both for original authors and as a learning experience for those who attempt to reproduce the work.


## **Event format**:

During a ReproHack, **participants attempt to reproduce published research of their choice from a list of proposed papers with publicly available associated code and data**. Participants get to work with other people's material in a low pressure environment and record their experiences on a number of key aspects, including reproducibility, transparency and reusability of materials. At the end of the day we regroup, share our experiences and feedback to the authors. 

It's imperative to note that  **ReproHacks are by no means an attempt to criticise or discredit work**. We see reproduction as **beneficial scientific activitiy in itself**, with useful outcomes for authors and valuable learning experiences for the participants and the research community as a whole.

***

## **Ways to participate**

<br>

### `r shiny::icon("newspaper")`  **Propose a paper**

##### You've put a lot of effort into making your work reproducible. Now let people learn from and engage with it! 

Benefits to authors:

- **Feedback** on the reproducibility of your work.

- **Appreciation** for your efforts in making your work reproducible.

- Opportunity to **engage others with your research**.

<br>

### `r shiny::icon("redo-alt")`  **Reproduce**

##### Join us at the ReproHack and get working with other people's material.

Benefits to participants include:

- **Practical experience in reproducibility** with real published materials and the opportunity to explore different tools and strategies.

- **Inspiration** from working with other people’s code and data.

- An appreciation that **reproducibility is non trivial** but that opening up your work for more people to engage with is the best way to help improve it.

- An appreciation that **reproducibility has community value beyond just the validation of the results**. For example,  access to such materials increases the potential for reuse and understanding of the work.

Benefits to the whole research community:

- Assessment of how reproducible papers are ‘out of the box’.

- Evaluation of how successful current practices are and for what purpose.

- Identification pf what works and where the most pressing weaknessess in our approaches are.

<br>

### `r shiny::icon("users-cog")`  **Hack**


##### There’s also opportunity for contributing to ReproHack development. 

Here's a few potential directions: 

- **Reproducible ReproHacks**: Build a toolkit to produce all materials required to run an event

- **Ability to sample from the literature.**: A call for papers doesn’t scale well and biases any data on reproducibility generated. It would be great to have a tool to sample the literature for papers to reproduce.

- **ReScience Submission Templates**: improvements in reproducbility might open the door for deeper treatment of materials and potentially moving towards replications. It would be great to provide a framework to submit work done during a ReproHack to the [**ReScience**](http://rescience.github.io/) journal.

More details on the [development topics](https://github.com/reprohack/reprohack-2019-06-27/blob/master/hack_topics.md)

Keep track of discussions and links to any outputs from our sessions on the event [**hackpad**](`r params$hackpad_url`)

# **PROPOSE**
### **Nominate a paper for Reproduction:**

We invite nominations for papers that have both associated **code** and **data** publicly available. We also encourage analyses based on open source tools as we cannot guarantee participant will have access to specialised licenced software.



```{r, echo=FALSE}
library("shiny")
 wellPanel(a("Nominate Paper", class = "btn btn-primary btn-md",
          href = params$submission_url))
```


## **Proposed papers:**

<br>

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=require('googlesheets')}
library(googlesheets)
```


```{r, message=FALSE, results='asis', warning=FALSE,  echo=FALSE}
responses_gs <- gs_title(paste(params$submission_form_title, "(Responses)"))
responses <- gs_read(responses_gs)

if(nrow(responses) > 0){

for(i in 1:nrow(responses)){
    cat('\n')     
    cat('\n')
    cat('\n')
    cat("### **", i,". ", as.character(responses[i, "Paper title"]), "**", "\n", "\n", sep = "")
    cat("**", gsub("\n", "", gsub("[*]", "", as.character(responses[i, "Paper citation"]))), "\n**", "\n", "\n", sep = "")
    cat("##### *submitted by ", as.character(responses[i, "Name"]),"*", "\n")
    cat('\n')
    cat('\n')
    cat("**Why should we attempt to reproduce this paper?**", "\n", "\n")
    cat(as.character(responses[i, "Why should we attempt to reproduce this paper?"]), "\n")
    cat('\n')
    cat("**Paper URL:** [", as.character(responses[i, "Paper URL"]),"](",as.character(responses[i, "Paper URL"]) ,")", "\n")
    cat('\n')
    cat("**Data URL:**", as.character(responses[i, "Data URL"]), "\n")
    cat('\n')
    cat("**Code URL:**", as.character(responses[i, "Code URL"]), "\n")
    cat('\n', "\n")
    cat("**Useful programming skills:**", as.character(responses[i, "Useful programming skills"]), "\n")
    cat('\n', "\n",'\n')
}

}
```

### ReproHack History


ReproHacks were inspired by **Owen Petchey's** [**Reproducible Research in Ecology, Evolution, Behaviour, and Environmental Studies course**](https://github.com/opetchey/RREEBES), where students attempt to  reproduce the analyses and figures of a paper from the raw data. We wanted to attempt to do the same but, while they take a few months over a number of sessions, for our first event we only had one day. So to condense that activity into one day we set the challenge to be: **reproduce results from published data AND code**.

We've run **two ReproHacks so far** as part of satellite OpenCon events (Berlin 2016, [London 2017](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/blog/opencon-london/)) with **a [series of them planned for 2019-2020](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/blog/ssi-fellowships-2019/) using funding provided through the [Software Sustainability Institute Fellowship programme](https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2019-04-11-announcing-2019-software-sustainability-institute-fellows)**.
