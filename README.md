# Carpentry Connect ReproHack 2019

## **Two ways to get involved:**

### **[Nominate a paper](https://forms.gle/aXjU4g3mVmpPJe6j7)**

We invite nominations **from anyone** and **for any type of open project**. For the #Reprohack, we especially invite authors that would like to **test one of their own papers!** Either way, we encourage proponents to seek consent from the original authors for their nominations. 

[**Current list of proposed papers and projects**](https://annakrystalli.shinyapps.io/OpenConLondon_Doathon/)

<br>


### [**Register as a participant**](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/opencon-london-2017-hackathon-tickets-38843068664)

Join us at the hack to **dig into exciting science**, learn more about **reproducibility**, working with **other people's code and data** and more!


***

## **On the day**

This is the master repo of the hack. We'll collect information on the teams and projects through [issues](https://github.com/OpenCon-London/OpenCon_London-Doathon/issues) in this repo. 

As all OpenCon events, we strive to make this event open and inclusive to all. As such the event is governed by the [OpenCon Code of Conduct](http://www.opencon2017.org/code_of_conduct) and you should read it before participating. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.



### **Authors**

We encourage authors that are keen, to be available for participants to reach out to for guidance or even just to say hello! We've set up a [**gitter channel**](https://gitter.im/OpenCon-London/OpenCon_London-Doathon) as a public lobby where you can also reach the organisers prior to the hack. You can start discussions through **issues** in each project repo and we've also set up a public, collaborative [**hackpad**](https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/OpenConLondon2017_Doathon).

### **Participants**

#### **1. Project and team selection**

We'll start by discussing the [**papers and projects proposed**](https://annakrystalli.shinyapps.io/OpenConLondon_Doathon/) and form into teams. We want to use github to keep track of the materials produced during the hack so we encourage teams to ensure they have someone with github skills on board. 


#### **2. Create project github repo (if applicable)**

 Individuals teams are requested to **create their own github repo** from which to coordinate individual projects.

#### **3. Register your project**
- Copy the text from the [**project registration issue template**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/annakrystalli/OpenConBerlin_ReproHack/master/.github/project_reg_tmpl.md).
- [**Create** a new issue](https://github.com/OpenCon-London/OpenCon_London-Doathon/issues/new) in **this** (the OpenCon London ReproHack) repo.
- **Paste** text copied from template.
- **Complete details** and save.

#### **4. Work on your project!**

Collect any materials generated during the hack in your **teams's github repo**. If you're trying to reproduce a paper, we recommend you do this in a **jupyter notebook**, **.rmarkdown** or any other literate programming document type. Here's an examples of such an [**output**](https://rawgit.com/opetchey/RREEBES/master/Beninca_etal_2008_Nature/report/report.html), the [raw Rmd code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opetchey/RREEBES/master/Beninca_etal_2008_Nature/report/report.Rmd) (link to [.Rdm file](https://github.com/opetchey/RREEBES/blob/master/Beninca_etal_2008_Nature/report/report.Rmd)) used to create it and the github [directory](https://github.com/opetchey/RREEBES/tree/master/Beninca_etal_2008_Nature) containing materials associated with the reproduction.

### **5. Leave feedback on the ReproHack papers**

Please complete the [**Reproducibility feedback form**](https://goo.gl/forms/EP8h3NydHkLTo8Hk2)
