# ReproHack development topics

- **Reproducible ReproHacks**: One of the goals is to make ReproHacks reproducible, ie develop customisable templates and tools so that hosts can run ReproHacks easily! Taking inspiration from [Carpentries workshop website deployments for event sites](https://carpentries.github.io/lesson-example/02-tooling/), and  [rOpenSci management of package reviews ](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues) to manage paper submissions and track reproductions, the plan is to develop a simple framework hosted on online repositories and making use of issue trackers. See [notes](https://hackmd.io/@U2KSpBasRLqM0fN-YALVrw/rJJSSIFhE) from an initial brainstorming sprint on the topic with the Sheffield RSE group.


- **Ability to sample from the literature.**: A call for papers doesn’t scale well and biases any data on reproducibility generated. It would be great to have a tool to sample the literature for papers to reproduce. Some useful potential resources:
  + Zenodo compendia ist maintained by @nuest : https://zenodo.org/communities/research-compendium/search?page=1&size=20
  + [Curate Science](https://curatescience.org/app/): a platform for researchers to label and link the transparency and replication of their research.

- **ReScience Submission Templates**: Another development avenue, suggested by [Hao Ye](https://haoye.us/) and sketched out in [this repository](https://github.com/annakrystalli/ReScience-reprohack) is the ability to publish reproductions in the [ReScience journal](http://rescience.github.io/). As reproducibility improves it allows for deeper treatment of the materials, engagement with the underlying science and opens the door to assessing replicability. Being able to get recognition for such efforts in journals like ReScience could provide valuable incentive for researchers to engage with materials and the process of reproducibility.

- **Remote Reprohacks**: [_Discussion Topic_] Another really interesting idea worth exploring, proposed by [Sina Rüeger](https://sinarueeger.github.io/) in the R-Ladies slack, is whether ReproHacks could be run remotely? I've found the co-location of participants in a low pressure environment with the ability to get help and troubleshoot with others worked really well for working through materials and learning. Can we replicate such an environment online, using Zoom for example?
